# marriage_slideshow

This slideshow made us have a really nice marriage in July 2022 :)

Hardware used:
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- TOSHIBA FlashAir 8 GB WiFi SD card W-02

It consists of three parts:

- the WiFi SD card configuration starting a web server on the SD card
- a sync job that regularly syncs files from the SD card to the RasPi Zero 2 W
- feh running in a lightdm kiosk environment showing randomly chosen pictures on the screen (a FullHD projector in our case)

Feel free to use it and enjoy a good time! :)
